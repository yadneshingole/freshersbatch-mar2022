#Create a script that, when run, will accept two command line values as arguments. These arguments should be a #username and password and assigned to two variables in the script named appropriately. Finally, echo those values #out to the terminal when run to indicate they were read and assigned as expected.

# Reading argument values individually
echo "Username : $1"
echo "Password : $2"
