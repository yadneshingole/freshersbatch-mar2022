Your company is ready to start using Docker on some of their servers. In order to get started, they want you to set up and configure Docker CE on a server that has already been set up. You will need to make sure that the server meets the following specifications:

Docker CE is installed and running on the server.
Use Docker CE version 5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic.
Any non-root user has permission to run docker commands.
The default logging driver is set to syslog.


[NOTE: Write the series of commands to achieve above in this file below the question scenario with documentation]


Install Docker CE on the server.
** First, set up the Docker Repository **

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install
apt-transport-https
ca-certificates
curl
gnupg-agent
software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository
"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu
$(lsb_release -cs)
stable"

**  Install docker packages **

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce=5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic docker-ce-cli=5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic containerd.io

** Verify that your installation is working **

sudo docker version

** Give nonroot user access to run Docker commands **

1. Add nonroot_user to the docker group.

sudo usermod -a -G docker nonroot_user

Log out of the server, then log back in.

2. Once you are logged back on, you can verify nonroot-userâ€˜s access:

docker version

** Set the default logging driver to syslog **

1. Edit daemon.json:

sudo vi /etc/docker/daemon.json

2. Add configuration to daemon.json to set the default logging driver.

{
"log-driver": "syslog"
}

3. Restart docker.

sudo systemctl restart docker


4. Verify that the logging driver was set properly like so:

docker info | grep Logging

5. This command should return a line that says:

Logging Driver: syslog
